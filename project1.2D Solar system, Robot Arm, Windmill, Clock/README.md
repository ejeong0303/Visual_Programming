Project1: 2D Solar system, Robot Arm, Windmill, Clock

1. Clock
   - rings the alarm bell every hour
   - makes a ticking sound every second
   - uses the datetime import to show the real time
   - work exactly the same as the real clock

3. Robot Arm
   - implemented with three robot arms with 3 joints and a gripper
   - speed of the three robot arms are equal
   - press a/b to move the first arm
   - press c/d to move the second arm
   - press e/f to move the third arm
   - press q/w to open/close the grippers

5. Solar System
   - consists the Sun, Earth, Mars and their moons
   - added the UFOs that move in random direction and speed with sound effects
   - the Earth, Mars, and their moons orbits and self rotates
   - drew the Earth and Mars's orbit path
   - reflects the real size of the planets and moons
   - added the glittering stars for the realistic solar system

7. Blackhole
   - used the rotation method to implement the blackhole
   - used random colors to express the glittering effect of the stars
   - stars swirl into the center of the screen
   - 1000 stars are created every run
   - sound effect added for the blackhole
   - new stars are created if more than 50% of the stars reach the center of the screen
